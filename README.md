# **NeuroNest - Cognitive Rehabilitation and Learning Support App**

## **Project Description**

**NeuroNest** is an interactive mobile application designed to support **cognitive rehabilitation** and **learning assistance** for individuals with:

* **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**
* **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**
* **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**

The app delivers **engaging, gamified exercises** targeting memory, attention, multitasking, and emotional recognition, along with **AI-driven assistance** and **early symptom screening** for primary diagnosis. It features specialized modes for children, elderly users, and dedicated tools for teachers and caregivers to assist autistic children.

Built using the **Flutter framework**, NeuroNest offers **offline-first functionality**, **Firebase cloud integration**, and **adaptive difficulty levels** to personalize therapy and learning experiences.

If you want, I can also create a **shorter, professional GitHub README version** with emojis, quick install instructions, and screenshots section so it‚Äôs more attractive for developers. This one is already research-oriented for papers and documentation.

Do you want me to prepare that developer-focused one too?
